### What Is This?

This is @andrew-d playing around with calling Rust's excellent [`regex`][re]
crate from Go... without paying overhead of [cgo][cgo] on every function call.
As mentioned in some work done by @BurntSushi ([here][rure]), the cgo function
overhead can eat up the gains you get from using the regex engine.

### How Does It Work?

First off, a huge thanks to Filippo Valsorda (@FiloSottile) for his [blog
post][rustgo] and work on [ed25519-dalek-rustgo][dal]; that project was used as
a starting point for this one.

The essentials behind how this works are very similar to those described in the
above blog post, with some modifications detailed below:

- We allocate new thread stacks with `mmap` and swap to these before calling
	our Rust code.  This lets us use arbitrarily-large stacks for Rust without
	needing to worry about Go's split stacks.  This also lets us mark the
	assembly function as `NOSPLIT`, which removes the prelude that checks for
	stack sizes, saving us a couple instructions :-)
- We don't use the `no_std` feature in Rust, since the `regex` library doesn't
	support it.
- I've wrapped the underlying Rust functions in a simple Go wrapper, exposing
	an API that requires no knowledge of the fact that it's using Rust under the
	hood.  Note that this is still a bit of a work-in-progress ðŸ˜ƒ
- I've switched from using `go tool` in the Makefile to generating `.syso`
	files, which Go will properly include when running `go build`.

### How Do I Try It Out Myself?

For now, this only works on OS X and Linux, and only on x86_64 platforms (since
it requires some assembly glue per-architecture and per-calling convention).
If you're on one of these platforms, great!  After cloning the repository, you
can run `make bench` in order to run a quick **non-scientific** benchmark
demonstrating the speedup.  On my reasonably-modern Linux desktop, I see
the following results:

```
BenchmarkGoRegexp        1000000              1466 ns/op
BenchmarkRustRegexp      5000000               255 ns/op
```
